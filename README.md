# HeRO<sub>2</sub>

Gas analyser with other extravagant features to complicated and simply divering

## Introduction

### Objectives

 1. To measure the oxygen and helium fractions in a gas mixture for scuba diving.
 2. To measure the water fraction of the gas mixture.
 3. Detect Carbon monoxide levels as a safety precaution

### Basic Methods

- Oxygen fraction will be measured using an electro-galvanic sensor.
- Helium fraction will be measured using an ultrasonic sensor via speed of sound calculations.
- Water fraction will be measured using Relative Humidity, temperature and atmospheric temperature.

### Assumptions

- Gas composition for speed of sound calculations includes only:
  - Helium ($He$)
  - Oxygen ($O_2$)
  - Nitrogen ($N_2$)
  - Water ($H_2O$)
- Carbon Monoxide ($CO$) levels will only be used as a safety measure.
