# HeRO<sub>2</sub>

Gas analyser for mixed gas divering.

## Objectives

### Main

-   To measure the oxygen and helium fractions in a gas mixture for scuba diving

### Secondary

-   To measure the water fraction of the gas mixture
-   Detect Carbon monoxide levels as a safety precaution

## Basic Methods

-   Oxygen fraction: electro-galvanic sensor
-   Helium fraction: ultrasonic sensor via speed of sound calculations
-   Water fraction: Relative Humidity, temperature and atmospheric temperature
-   Carbon monoxide: TBD

## Details
- [Background & Approach](./Background.md)
- [Design & Layout](./Design.md)

## Circuit
This circuit is now outdated, a new diagram is forthcoming. 
major change is reducing the the number of ultrasonic modules to one.
